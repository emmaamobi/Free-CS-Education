Hello World.
=============

This site is dedicated to providing links to websites, textbooks, videos, etc. that would benefit any student who is studying Computer Science or a related field.

I take great pride in the work that the community has done in discovering resources that provide solid, reputable information beneficial to anyone and everyone.

With that being said, I cannot personally vouch for every resource here. Nor do I have authority to control the content of every resource here as well. Thus, if there is an issue with a resource, I recommend creating an issue on our `GitHub page`_.

While on that subject, if you would like to add resources to this project, please create a pull request containing the changes that you want to make to the website.

Best of luck, and happy learning.

Sincerly,

Nicholas Synovic
